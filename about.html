    <article class="bio content-reveal">
      <p>I grew up in the suburbs of Boston, where evenings were split between trying to become the ultimate Pokémon trainer on my Nintendo 3DS and writing tiny calculator programs on the family PC. That early fascination with games, technology, and problem-solving led me to Williams College, where I am now pursuing a B.A. in Mathematics & Computer Science with the long-term goal of entering video-game development.</p>

      <p>At Williams I have explored the breadth of computer science—from designing accessible interfaces in Human-Computer Interaction, to leveraging large-language models in Machine Learning, to analyzing algorithmic complexity in Theory of Computation. I also conducted research through the Williams SMALL REU, developing efficient algorithms for generating spanning trees and multiset permutations—experience that sharpened both my theoretical insight and my collaborative skills.</p>

      <p>Beyond code, I unwind with Indian serials, horror films, and endless re-reads of the <em>Harry Potter</em> series. Dance is another passion: you can catch clips of my performances with Williams’ Asian Dance Troupe online. Whether tackling new challenges, mentoring peers as a residential advisor, or collaborating across diverse student groups, I’m fueled by curiosity and a drive to keep learning.</p>

      <p>I’m always happy to connect—feel free to reach out at <strong>kp12@williams.edu</strong>.</p>
