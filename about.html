    <article class="bio content-reveal">
      <p>I grew up in the suburbs of Boston, where nights after finishing homework were split between trying to become the ultimate Pokémon trainer on my Nintendo 3DS and writing tiny calculator programs on our family PC. This early fascination with games, technology, and problem-solving led me to Williams College, where I am now about to finish a B.A. in Mathematics & Computer Science with the hope of entering video-game development.</p>

      <p>At Williams I have explored the breadth of computer science, whether it be from designing accessible interfaces in Human-Computer Interaction, leveraging large-language models in Machine Learning, or analyzing algorithmic complexity in Theory of Computation. These learning opportunities carried me into conducting research through the Williams SMALL REU, developing efficient algorithms for generating spanning trees and multiset permutations. These experiences in and outside of the classroom sharpened both my theoretical insight and my collaborative skills.</p>

      <p>Beyond code, I unwind with Indian serials, horror films, and countless re-reads of the Harry Potter series. Dance is another passion of mine: you can even find clips of my performances with Williams’ Asian Dance Troupe (ADT) online. Whether tackling new challenges, mentoring peers as a Junior Advisor, or collaborating across diverse student groups, I’m fueled by curiosity and a drive to keep learning.</p>

      <p>I’m always happy to connect—feel free to reach out at <strong>kp12@williams.edu</strong>.</p>
